									<h2>Background<a href="#" 
										class="image main"><img src="images/background.jpg" alt="" 
										style="width: 500px; height: auto;"/></a></h2> 
									
									<p>My name is Andrew Rios and I was born October 2nd, 2004 (19 years old).
										I was born here in the U.S. but I have a hispanic background from Mexico and Venezuela. A big part of my cultural background 
										is religion and the values that come with being a Christian. Being the oldest out of two siblings my biggest value and 
										strength is determination. To be able to pass these values down to them is something I find significant and influential on our 
										relationship. 
									</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Goals<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/goalspic.jpg" 
										alt="" style="width: 200px; height: auto;"/></a></h2>
									
									<p>Through out my time at the UW I want to gain as much experience in programming as I can that will help me choose the career 
										that is right for me. After getting my degree in CS I want to further my education and start grad school. All of this is so that 
										I can repay my parents for everything they have given my brothers and I. Knowing how much my parents have sacrifieced to give me a 
										life in the U.S., and how much more they sacrifice everyday to keep us happy, is what pushes me the most to achieve these goals. 
									</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Work Experience<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/work1.jpg" alt="" 
										style="width: 200px; height: auto;"/></a></h2>
									<p>For the past year and a half I've been working as a head lifeguard at the <a href="https://mtrainierpool.com/">Mount Rainier Pool</a>. 
									Along with 7 other head guards, I was responsible for 35 staff in a high pressure enviroment. Each month I helped conduct 
									staff trainings and was responsible for the attendance of staff to these trainings. Lastly, I trained new staff in areas
									of lifeguarding, swim lessons, and customer service.</p>
									<hr />
									<h2>Hobbies<a href="#" class="image main"><img src="images/hobbies.jpg" alt="" 
										style="width: 200px; height: auto;"/></a></h2>
									<p>The two main hobbies I have currently are snowboarding and coding. I consider coding a hobby because although
										most of it is from studying and doing homework, I find it fun and intriguing. I get the same feelings from working on 
										code that I do from playing video. When I'm coding, it's like time speeds up and hours have passed when it feels like its 
										only been minutes. Another enjoyment of life that I have is snowboarding. Like coding, snowboarding is a source of dopamine 
										for me. A way to get away from life and responsibilities. And when I'm not snowboarding or coding, I spend time with my family 
										and friends.
